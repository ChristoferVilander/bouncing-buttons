# bouncing-buttons
A menu which opens with a bounce effect. It might not be the best of menus from a UX point of view, but on the other hand â€“ I created it just to be able to play around with CSS Animations.  The demo uses a tiny bit of JS to open and close the menu and CSS Animations for the bounce effect.
